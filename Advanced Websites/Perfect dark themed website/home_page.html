    <button class="accordion">Ranks In CodeKingdom</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p class="nz">So, the ground rules were clear, now we have just come to ranks. There are 2 Supreme Presidents
            the creators (namely Yash Bhatnagar and Nigamanth Srivatsan)
            <br> <br> There are other ranks as well and here they are, with their importance and power level in
            descending order: (which means most powerful first)
            <br> <br> 1. Supreme Presidents: Supreme power, they can do anything but fire presidents <br> <br>
            2. Presidents: Can do anything (can’t demote or promote others), but change the Rules <br> <br>
            3. Senior-Vice Presidents, can organize fights and battles <br> <br>
            4. Vice President, gives speeches and organizes learning events <br> <br>
            5. Senior-Senator, listens to everyone in elections and tries to get a seat <br> <br>
            6. Senator, high but can easily be defeated in parliament <br> <br>
            7. Vice-Senator, not that high, assistants of the Senators <br> <br>
            8. Member of Parliament, just a common guy sitting and coding in the parliament <br> <br>
            9. Assistant Member of Parliament, debugging the code <br> <br>
            10. Knight, has just started off <br> <br>
            11. Citizen, knows nothing about code and is a beginner <br> <br>
            <br> Now, each one of these has some buff or the other (other than the last few). You will get badges for
            each rank that you improve on, and the one where you start.
            <br> The ranks are based on how much coding you know, well that takes you till the rank of Senator, which is
            high in the beginning, since there are barely any senators and there are no senior senators. But if you join
            late then there will be senior senators.
            <br> Additionaly, you can skip a rank as well, lets say you get much better in the span of a week and you
            actually are 2 ranks ahead of what you were, then we will only give you the badge of the second one.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nzh"> How to get Past the Senator Rank?</h2>
        <p class="nz">To get past the senator rank is hard, but not impossible.
            No-one other than the creators will have Supreme Chancellor Rank, but President is almost as high as Supreme
            Presidents.
            And, if you are president then the Supreme Presidents can’t fire you.
            Besides, if you just stay for 6 months as a Senator without getting fired, you become a senior senator.
            The president elections will be done every quarter (3 months), the president gets to choose 2 senior
            senators/senators to be Vice President, and senior Vice President only happens, when you have been President
            done a decent job and the Supreme Presidents guaranteed will choose you as the Senior Vice President
            <br>
        </p> <br> <br>
        <h2 class="nzh"> Senior Vice President vs Vice President </h2>
        <p class="nz">Now the vice president is high, but is the Senior Vice President higher: No. The Senior Vice
            President sounds higher and is more trustworthy, because to be Senior Vice President you have to be
            President before. Otherwise the Senior-Vice President can’t do anything that the Vice President cannot do.

        <p class="nz">The creators have an interesting Story, which comes across many aspects of life.
            <b>We think that code should be avalible to everyone and everyone should learn how to code.
            </b> Well, the 21st century has a lot to come, including AI, AR, and VR which infact has already come.
            These were actually built from code, roughly around 10000 lines of code. But, everyone should be able to
            write that much code in a couple of years, so start now. What is the worst that could happen? Code is very
            important to know
            at least like 6-7 programming languages, so pick a plan. And start reading our blog on code. </p>
