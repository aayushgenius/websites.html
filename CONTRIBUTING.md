# Contributing to Your-Coding-Journey
## If you are not a contributor
If your not a contributor on this repository you can email the staff team at nigamanth.srivatsan@gmail.com
Which means all your issues about stuff will be there. 
The requirements to become a contributor
* You need to know at least 3 coding languages (a good mix between them would be nice!)
* You need to have a git repository with at least 100 clones a month!
* You need to have been coding for at least 1 year. 
* You need to have at least 2000 lines of code at your disposal the second you become a contributor.
* The minimum commit schedule in lines of code should be 10,000 lines of code an year otherwise you will stop becoming a collaborator
* You must reply to at least 10 issues an year (if people have those many)
* You must upload at least 1 package an year

## If you are already a contributor
Tips for contributing without getting into trouble:
* Upload at least 1000 lines of code at one time
* Upload in organized files and folders
* DO NOT delete files unecesarily
* DO NOT pull request that often (there might be some exceptions)
* If there is already a folder related to what your uploading i.e. Your uploading a .php file for cookies but then you see there already is
a folder for PHP rather than commiting to it on the clean thing, upload the folder inside that specific folders, as it would be more organized

Enjoy uploading your work!
